# Implement PBPK model of albumin 

Model was published in Liu et al, J Pharmacokinet. Pharmacodyn, 2024.

What's new about this model: albumin penetrate tissue, modelled using two-pore theory; in addition, albumin also have extended half life following FcRn-mediated recycline 

# Verification 

The model verification was carried out in mouse and human
